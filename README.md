This is a sample EPUB 3 document that I use for testing and examples.

The file contains a variety of features that may be of interest to eBook developers, such as:

1. A well-structured OPF file, including good examples of metadata for EPUB 3.
2. HTML5 markup, with examples of different kinds of markup that you might run into in an EPUB file.
3. Backwards compatibility with EPUB 2.
3. The file passes [FlightDeck](http://ebookflightdeck.com) with flying colors!
4. The index is set up for future support for the Indexes markup in EPUB 3.
5. Proper use of semantic markup and accessibility features.
6. ...and more!
