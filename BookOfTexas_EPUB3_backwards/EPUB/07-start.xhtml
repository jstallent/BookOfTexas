<p class="first"><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="leadin">ortunately for the reputations</span> of those who write or talk of Texas, it is next to impossible to tell lies about her; almost anything that may be said is true somewhere, some time. Tell of beetling cliffs where eagles scarce may find a perch and of plains so level that rainwater cannot drain away, tell of sudden cloudbursts and of almost endless droughts, of huge crops and of famine, of boiling heat and freezing cold, of luxuriant woodlands and bare deserts, of immense cattle ranches and small truck farms, of flourishing cities and uninhabited wastes, of soil without rocks and rocks without soil, of long railways and trackless plains, of dry rivers and turbid floods, of jewelled humming-birds and repulsive vultures, of tropic fruits and northern pines, of pistol-toting desperadoes and self-sacrificing preachers, of beautiful libraries and towns without books, of million-dollar hotels and dirt-covered dugouts&#x2014;tell a thousand contradictory things about Texas, and if you seem to lie it is not because of what you have said but because you have told only a part of the truth. George Washington, had he been a Texan, would have found it doubly impossible to tell a lie about Texas.</p>
<p class="ind"><span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexii" title="xii"/>Stretching halfway from Mexico to Canada and a third of the distance from the Atlantic to the Pacific, covering a twelfth of the United States, rising in elevation from sea-level to almost 9,000 feet, ranging from quite humid to quite arid and from 115&#x00B0; in the shade to 16&#x00B0; below in the sun, possessing thousands of square miles of desert and millions of acres of soil of unsurpassed fertility, blessed with a fair proportion of mineral wealth, located at the meeting of East and West, reaching south almost to the Tropics, containing most of the great life zones of North America, sparsely inhabited by some four millions of people, rapidly increasing in population and wealth and civilization, Texas is a land of amazing contrasts.</p>

<p class="ind">It is quite the fashion in Texas to speak of &#x201C;our imperial commonwealth&#x201D; and to compare it in size with New England and other lesser portions of the surface of the earth, greatly to the implied disadvantage of many excellent regions. In fact, Texas exceeds New England in area, with New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the two Virginias thrown in for good measure. Texas is slightly larger than Austria-Hungary or England and France, or England and Germany, appreciably larger than Spain and Portugal, over twice as large as Italy, and almost exactly three times as large as Great Britain. Such are the comparisons dear to your patriotic Texan, who never says anything about Arabia which is over four, or about Brazil which is just twelve, or about Siberia which is nearly twenty times <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexiii" title="xiii"/>as large as Texas. In arranging a contest it is well to pick your opponent with care.</p>
<p class="ind">From Texarkana in the northeastern corner to El Paso in the western it is farther than from New York to Chicago. The distance from Brownsville in the southern corner to Texline in the northwestern exceeds that from Tampa to Washington. Take a map of the United States and with a pair of compasses stretched from Texarkana to El Paso draw a circle with Texarkana as a centre; perhaps you will be astonished to see the circle cut across Lake Michigan. Use the distance from Brownsville to Texline as a radius and El Paso as a centre, and the circle runs far out into the Pacific Ocean. Made into a square, Texas would have sides a little over five hundred miles in length. Texas is not as long as, but is much broader than, California, her nearest competitor in area among the states. She exceeds California in size by more than 100,000 square miles.</p>

<p class="ind">A fearsome combination of spiny cactus and thorny shrub, of stinging lizard and vinegarroon, of centipede and rattlesnake, of Gila monster and black tarantula, of large red ant and &#x201C;hydrophobia&#x201D; skunk, may be selected from the Texas fauna to make a witches&#x2019; cauldron amply sufficient to petrify gullible greenhorns and long-eared tourists with terror. Yet if accident insurance companies were to insure, &#x201C;free, gratis, and for nothing&#x201D; against damage from these unpleasant natives they would not lose much money. Killing noxious animals when he meets them, picking its thorns <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexiv" title="xiv"/>from his skin when he accidently collides with a cactus, the Texan goes on his way rejoicing and unharmed. Mockingbirds singing in feathery mesquites, vultures soaring at vast altitudes in cloudless skies, scissor-tail fly-catchers quarrelling in mid-air, lark sparrows scattered over the short grass prairies, doves cooing endlessly everywhere, chaparral birds running across the roads, killdeers by the ponds, cattle grazing or at rest under the &#x201C;mottes&#x201D; of trees with cow birds about them, rabbits crouching by the roadside, prairie dogs barking on their mounds, thousands of acres of prairie flowers, millions of yellow blooming mesquite and still yellower huisache, tall pine forests and duck-covered swamps, fields white with the opening cotton and golden with the ripening wheat and corn and oats, cattle on the prairies, pecan and other trees along the river banks where sits the summer fisherman, tarpon leaping six feet out of the Gulf when hooked by the skilful angler, buttermilk and cornbread and thick pot-licker, soft breezes blowing over hill and dale, hot mid-days and cool nights, long summers and short winters, bull-bats booming at dusk, frogs and crickets and katydids and mocking-birds and chuck-will-widows and owls crying in the night, hundred-pound watermelons and long juicy roasting ears, &#x201C;garden truck&#x201D; without limit in amount or variety&#x2014;to such things the Texan is accustomed. As everywhere, in Texas good and bad are to be found contemporaneously and successively, the rose and the thorn go together, and, as once said by a postprandial Texas orator, <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexv" title="xv"/>&#x201C;The song of the mocking-bird keeps me from hearing the boll weevil bowling at the cotton-boll.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">Varied the land and various the people! Viewed here and there by Spaniards and Frenchmen of the age of exploration, dotted sparsely with Spanish missions in the eighteenth century, Texas was left almost entirely to the aboriginal Comanche, Apache, Karankawa, Tejas, and other Indian tribes until the nineteenth century was well under way. Then in ever-increasing swarms came the Anglo-American, bringing his colored Afro-American with him, and the inevitable conflict between the English and Spanish civilizations, thus brought into contact, broke out almost at once, and resulted in Texas soon becoming one of the United States. Six flags have waved over Texas&#x2014;the fleur-de-lis of France, the banner of Spain, the flag of the Mexican Republic, the Lone Star flag that floated when Texas, alone among her sister states, was for a brief space an independent republic; the Stars and Stripes of the American Union; and, for a short while only, the Stars and Bars of the Southern Confederacy.</p>
<p class="ind">Of the Indians less than one thousand are left. To the few Spaniards and Mexicans and Americans of the days of the Republic of Texas immigration has added a mighty swarm of Southerners and a large number of Northerners, Germans, Bohemians, English, Irish, Italians, Swedes, and a sprinkling from every other European country. From these, of course, have come many native Texans. The state is <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexvi" title="xvi"/>more &#x201C;American&#x201D; than the United States as a whole, despite the fact that one-sixth of the population is negro and another sixth is German and Mexican. The earliest European inhabitants were Spanish soldiers, monks, and pioneers; the next were American frontiersmen. These last were quickly followed by settlers from the older states, by Germans and more Americans. All came as a part of that westward movement whose story is the major part of American history. All came because a fair land offering golden opportunities lay spread before them, and for the same reason many others yet unborn will come. American with a large European element, Southern, of course, rather than Northern in flavor, but with a strong spice of the West, Texas stands to-day&#x2014;as described by Yancey Lewis, one of her noblest and truest orators&#x2014;a &#x201C;great commonwealth, marked out by area, by climatic conditions, by physical environment, and by the indwelling spirit of its people, for empire,&#x201D; a &#x201C;huge leviathan among the states, not yet articulate, not yet having the unity of its highest purpose, nor wrought to its best hope, but destined ultimately, in my view, to speak with the strongest and most individual voice of all our states.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">As best it can this book tells of Texas. A complete, even an approximate, description is impossible; the totality included under the name of Texas is too vast to be arranged in correct proportion and woven into an easily intelligible and therefore not overcrowded picture. To depict Texas however dimly in a single volume it is necessary to paint with a <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pagexvii" title="xvii"/>broad brush and yet sometimes to show important details with the truthfulness of a miniature. A true account of the coming of her people into the broad land of Texas would be a great epic, a true picture of the work of her people to-day would be a gigantic panorama. All that this book can hope to do is to present, inadequately but not untruthfully, some lines of the epic and some scenes of the panorama; to deal briefly and imperfectly with big and significant things without neglecting details that possess local color and human interest.</p>
