<p class="first"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="leadin">exas was not settled</span> by Americans through forcible occupation. Just before Mexico won its independence from Spain, in 1821, Moses Austin secured permission through the Spanish Governor at San Antonio to bring three hundred families to Texas. His son, Stephen F. Austin, a young man twenty-seven years of age, carried out the contract, offering each settler six hundred and forty acres of choice land at twelve and one-half cents an acre. These families he settled on the Brazos River, one of the three principal streams in the state, about one hundred miles from the Gulf of Mexico. After Mexico had gained her independence from Spain a general law was passed inviting immigration to Texas. To every married man was offered a league of land (4,428 acres), while a bonus of 23,000 acres was given to anybody who would bring with him one hundred families. Austin, the first to undertake the work, made contracts to bring in an additional fifteen hundred families, while a dozen other contracts for a smaller number of families were made by other individuals. At least one enthusiast petitioned to settle one hundred and fifty Mexican families in the state. The greater number of these colonists were from Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia; though some <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page11" title="11"/>came from New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio. People of all classes came. The Southern cotton planter moved due west overland in covered wagons, called prairie schooners, bringing with him his slaves; the Northern man came seeking opportunity for his son; the &#x201C;poor white trash&#x201D; of the South came hoping to escape the social and economic disadvantages of the densely populated slave communities. Along with these journeyed lawyers, doctors, merchants, blacksmiths, and enough adventurers to perpetuate the story that Texas was a land of desperadoes. Within fifteen years after the time Austin secured his grant there were probably not less than thirty thousand Americans in Texas. The settlements were mainly located below the old military road which ran from San Antonio to Nacogdoches, and along the bottoms or lowlands of the San Antonio, Guadalupe, Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity rivers. At this time Texas was a part of the State of Coahuila, the capital being first Saltillo and later Monclova. The state was under the control of a governor and legislature elected by the people, Texas having as her superior officer a political chief who lived at San Antonio. The principal officer in each town was the alcalde, whose duties included, roughly, those of mayor and justice of the peace. Being so far removed from the central government in the City of Mexico, the colonists naturally ran their affairs very much as they pleased. Their relatives were usually in the United States, and their correspondence, visits, and trading were chiefly in that direction. When they had children to educate they sent them back to their old homes. No very strong ties, therefore, were formed with their adopted country.</p>
<p class="ind"><span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page12" title="12"/>And when trouble came, as it was bound to come quickly, with two so widely diverse civilizations brought into close contact, the sympathy of the people of the United States was with their friends and neighbors who had so recently become citizens of an alien country. Within five years after reaching Texas, the group of colonists who settled near Nacogdoches organized a revolution and planned a free and independent state, to be called Fredonia. This revolution quelled, the Mexican Government, in order to reduce emigration from the United States, first issued a decree (which it immediately suspected, as far as Texas was concerned) freeing the slaves, the principal asset of the cotton planter; the law of 1830 forbade absolutely, with certain exceptions, the coming of more Americans to Texas; the same law proposed to settle convicts permanently in the state, and soldiers were stationed at various strategic points to intimidate the settlers. An especially obnoxious provision of this law provided for the levying of import duties on all goods except those that came from Mexico. Again it is seen how easily the anger of a people can be aroused through what they deem to be unjust taxation. When the people rose and imprisoned the revenue collectors and drove out from Texas the Mexican soldiers that had been stationed there, punishment would certainly have been visited upon them save for the fact that Mexico was undergoing a revolution in which Santa Anna was the victor. The success of the Texans, however, strengthened their contempt for the Mexicans; it gave them confidence in themselves and probably brought them substantial encouragement from friends in the United States. Soon afterward Sam Houston wrote a constitution <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page13" title="13"/>for Texas, one of the provisions of which separated it from Coahuila, and this constitution was forwarded to Mexico to be presented in person by Stephen F. Austin to Santa Anna. As a result of this journey Austin was thrown into prison for fifteen months. The indignation of the Texans over his detention in a dark dungeon, and the action of Santa Anna in stationing soldiers in Texas and ordering several prominent citizens to be sent to Mexico for trial, aroused the entire people to such a pitch of indignation that only the force of arms could settle the issue. When the peace-loving Austin returned from Mexico in 1835 he announced in a circular letter: &#x201C;War is our only resource. There is no other remedy but to defend our rights, ourselves, and our country by force of arms.&#x201D;</p>

<p class="ind">It required only fifteen years to show that free-born Americans could not live under the edicts of a tyrannical Mexican dictator. The people who had come to Texas up to that time were of the typical frontier type, restless, red-blooded folk, unused to oppression, impatient of restraint of any character; widely different in religion, in their notion of popular education, and in the freedom of the individual, from the people under whose rule they attempted to live. Moreover, from the first the two peoples mutually distrusted each other, and for the dark-skinned, low-caste Mexican a Southern man, in particular, had little more genuine respect than he did for the negro slave. As one of the early settlers writes in his reminiscences, he thought the &#x201C;Mexicans little better than monkeys.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">But the Texans faced a serious situation. The Mexican Government under the rule of Santa Anna had a large standing <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page14" title="14"/>army, a part of which immediately crossed the Rio Grande. After San Antonio had been captured by the Texans, and several skirmishes had been fought, Santa Anna besieged San Antonio with a large army. William B. Travis, who was then in command of the Texans at that point, took refuge in the Alamo, a part of an old mission which still remains standing. With him were such men as Bowie, of the family that gave its name to the bowie knife; David Crockett, only recently come from Tennessee, and one hundred and ninety other men of similar spirit and determination. Surrounded and besieged with little hope of rescue, Travis sent out this call for help:</p>

	<p class="noind italic">To the People of Texas and all Americans in the world.</p>
	<p class="ind">Fellow Citizens and Compatriots: I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna. I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to put to the sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the walls. <em>I shall never surrender or retreat.</em> Then I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country. VICTORY OR DEATH!</p>

	<p class="ind top30">P. S. The Lord is on our side. When the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn. We have since found in deserted houses 80 or 90 bushels and got into the walls of 20 or 30 head of beeves.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page15" title="15"/>Ten days later, on March 6th, the Mexicans made a general assault. When it was over not a Texan was left alive, while around the Alamo were the dead bodies of six or seven hundred Mexicans. The chapel of the Alamo still stands, a holy spot for Texas patriots. The sacrifice of Travis and his brave companions has been embalmed in the stirring words &#x201C;<span class="italic">Thermopylae had its messenger of defeat; but the Alamo had none.</span>&#x201D; Two weeks later Colonel Fannin and four hundred men surrendered to an overpowering Mexican army near Goliad.

<p class="ind">The fall of the Alamo and the massacre at Goliad convulsed the settlers with fear. They fled from their homes in terror before the advance of Santa Anna&#x2019;s army, now separated into three divisions marching eastward at a considerable distance from each other, Santa Anna himself being in command of the main and central division. Before him, Gen. Sam Houston and his Texans retreated until, the invaders being separated from the chance of quick reinforcements, Houston met the Mexican army in battle a short distance down the bayou from the present city of Houston. Here 800 Texas militiamen with little military training charged 1,300 Mexican soldiers on the afternoon of April 21,1836, giving as their battle cry, &#x201C;<span class="italic">Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!</span>&#x201D; In half an hour 600 Mexicans lay dead, 730 were either wounded or captured, while the Texans lost only two killed and twenty-three wounded. Santa Anna himself was among the prisoners.</p>
<p class="ind">The battle of San Jacinto was the Yorktown of Texas; it won the independence of the Texas Republic. April 21st <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page16" title="16"/>is yet a legal holiday as well as March 2d, when the Independence of Texas was declared. The concluding words of this Declaration of Independence are:</p>
<p class="ind">&#x201C;We therefore, the delegates, with plenary powers, of the people of Texas, in solemn convention assembled, appealing to a candid world for the necessities of our condition, do hereby resolve and declare that our political connection with the Mexican nation has forever ended; and that the people of Texas do now constitute a free, sovereign, and independent republic, and are fully invested with all the rights and attributes which properly belong to independent nations; and, conscious of the rectitude of our intentions, we fearlessly and confidently commit the issue to the decision of the Supreme Arbiter of the destinies of nations.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">Some of the indictments in the same historical paper read: &#x201C;It [the Mexican Government] has failed and refused to secure on a firm basis the right of trial by jury, that palladium of civil liberty and only safe guarantee for the life, liberty, and property of the citizen. It has failed to establish any public system of education, altho&#x2019; possessed of almost boundless resources (the public domain), and, although it is an axiom, in political science, that unless the people are educated and enlightened it is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty or the capacity for self-government. It has demanded the surrender of a number of our citizens and ordered military detachments to seize and carry them into the interior for trial, in contempt of the civil authorities and in defiance of the laws and the constitution. It denies us the right of worshipping the Almighty according to the dictates of our own conscience, by the support of a national religion <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page17" title="17"/>calculated to promote the temporal interests of its human functionaries rather than the glory of the true and living God. It hath been during the whole time of our connection with it the contemptible sport and victim of successive military revolutions; and hath continually exhibited every characteristic of a weak, corrupt, and tyrannical government. The necessity of self-preservation now decrees our eternal political separation.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">In the &#x201C;Consultation&#x201D; held just prior to the convention that declared the independence of Texas, three commissioners were selected to go to the United States and ask for aid. Aid did come, and many of the men who died in the Alamo, who were murdered at Goliad, and a few who fought with Houston at San Jacinto, were volunteers who had come into Texas as a result of the commission&#x2019;s call for help. Indeed, the United States army afterward gave material aid indirectly by sending General Gaines and a detachment of soldiers to Nacogdoches in order to keep the Cherokee Indians in east Texas from rising while the settlers were busy restoring their homes destroyed by the invading Mexicans.</p>
<p class="ind">Little need be added to this brief account of the Texas revolution. Its causes are plainly apparent: the two peoples could not mix, and the law of the &#x201C;survival of the fittest&#x201D; operated here as everywhere else. The Mexican mind and character would have to be made over before it would be competent to rule a people whose birthrights are the Anglo-Saxon notion of civil liberty and the Anglo-Saxon conception of individual freedom. Even had Santa Anna temporarily driven the Texans from the land, so fair a country having <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page18" title="18"/>been once seen and coveted, the tide of American immigration would have soon again swept westward and overwhelmed all opposition to its possession.</p>
<hr class="bluebonnet"/>
<p class="ind">For nearly a decade the Republic of Texas exercised the ordinary function of a free and independent nation. Every three years it elected a president and a vice-president, the president not being eligible to successive reelection. It maintained a congress and a judicial system; it supported an army and a considerable navy and sent diplomats to various foreign countries. Naturally the United States was the first country to recognize the independence of Texas; this recognition being followed by the Netherlands, France, and England. England manifested a keen interest in Texas throughout its independence, an interest that has been interpreted as a desire to possess the country. Many citizens of the republic were immigrants from England. The financial concerns of that country also held a large amount of Mexican securities; then, too, England no doubt desired to control a region capable of producing cotton for her mills, and Texas from the beginning was recognized as an ideal cotton-growing state.</p>

<p class="ind">But before the government could be put into smooth running condition, order had to be brought out of the chaos resulting from the Mexican invasion. The people who had fled returned to find their homes burned to the ground, their cattle and crops destroyed. But the Anglo-Saxons came back, as they generally always do. The captured Mexican soldiers were retained as prisoners for a year, while a treaty was made with Santa Anna (which the Mexican <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" title="19"/>government repudiated) providing for the independence of Texas; then, despite the fact that he had personally ordered the storming of the Alamo and the wholesale murder at Goliad, he was after a time set free. His return to Mexico marked the beginning of years of trouble from the southwest.</p>
<p class="ind">In September, 1836, the people of the Republic voted, with only ninety-one dissenting ballots, their assent that Texas should be annexed to the United States. At the same tune they ratified a constitution, and for President chose Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto, over Stephen F. Austin, the Father of Texas. The constitution made liberal provision for the support of the government, allowing the President a salary of $10,000 a year in contrast to the $4,000 salary now paid to a Texas Governor. President Houston found himself facing a public debt of more than a million dollars, which, despite his economies, largely through the policies of President Lamar, had increased to twelve million dollars by the close of the Republic. From its beginning the government was poor in ready cash but rich in land. Indeed, like many Texans in later years, the government was really &#x201C;land poor&#x201D;; for there could be little sale of immense tracts of the public domain when the government gave away six hundred and forty acres to every married man who would settle on it and three hundred and twenty acres to every unmarried man. It also gave to each county fifteen thousand acres and presented to the public schools and to its state university then and later splendid landed endowments amounting to many millions of acres.</p>
<p class="ind">When the battle of San Jacinto was fought there were probably thirty thousand Americans in Texas and about fifteen thousand Indians. During the ten years of the Republic <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page20" title="20"/>the white race increased to one hundred thousand, while the great majority of the Indians were either killed in battle or driven from the country. Much of the public debt, which increased rapidly during this time, arose from maintaining a frontier defense against the incursion of hostile Indians, sometimes incited by Mexican leaders; and from invasions of Mexican soldiery in the desultory war carried on between Texas and Mexico practically throughout the whole period. By 1850 the population of the state was 200,000. The influx of people had come mainly from the Southern States and from the central portion of the Eastern States, though at the same time a considerable number of German immigrants had settled in various sections of the Republic. Some counties in Texas are at this time mainly populated by a German citizenship, and in a few instances practically only the German language is spoken in good-sized towns, Fredericksburg and New Braunfels being two examples. Despite the law that the English language shall be taught in every public school in the state, there are yet some backwoods German communities which teach only the German language. A like practice is followed by the Mexicans in a few of the Rio Grande border counties where even the court records are kept in the Spanish language.</p>
<hr class="bluebonnet"/>
<p class="ind">The Texans, by winning their independence from Mexico practically single-handed and unsupported, achieved a glory which is the pride of their descendants. It cannot be said, however, that the ten years of their maintenance of an independent republic was markedly successful. The war was not of sufficient duration to weld the different communities <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page21" title="21"/>into one people. The rapid influx of immigration brought additional distracting problems. The troubles with the Indians and with Mexico continued throughout the period. During Lamar&#x2019;s administration an ill-starred invasion or two of Mexico resulted not only in great loss of life but also in adding to the public debt. The Santa Fe expedition into New Mexico, in order to establish Texas&#x2019; claim to all the land east of the Rio Grande (more than half of the present State of New Mexico), proved disastrous. During most of this period Mexico herself was disturbed by the continuous revolt of factional chieftains; otherwise the lot of the new Republic would not have been so easy. A crowd of adventurers from Texas at one time crossed over the Rio Grande in an abortive attempt to found an additional nation in the northern part of Mexico to be known as the Republic of the Rio Grande. During this period Mexico twice invaded Texas, San Antonio being each time captured. In return an army of Texans, which came to be known as the Mier Expedition, invaded Mexico. After its capture the Texans were again subjected to an example of Mexican cruelty. Each one of the 176 men was required to draw a bean from a bag in which every tenth bean was black, the rest being white. The seventeen men who drew black beans were then taken out and shot.</p>
<p class="ind">The dread of Mexican invasion and domination kept annexation talk alive during all the days of the Republic. The slowness of the United States to act was due mainly to the disinclination of the men in power at Washington to further complicate the slavery situation by annexing Texas with the possibility of having a slave state cut into four or five states <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" title="22"/>each with two United States Senators. Another consideration that gave the United States Government pause was the fact that the annexation of Texas meant certain war with Mexico. Early in the year 1845, however, Congress acted favorably on the proposition, and on July 4th of the same year a convention of delegates met at Austin, Texas, to decide whether Texas should accept annexation. Alarmed at the course of affairs, Mexico offered to recognize the independence of Texas and make peace if Texas would refuse the offer of the United States Government. No attention was paid to this offer, and the Texans voted to accept the proposition of the United States. Under the terms of the agreement Texas was to retain all of her public domain, while the United States Government declined to assume the state&#x2019;s public debt of ten million dollars.</p>
<p class="ind">The three presidents of the Texas Republic were Sam Houston, a Tennesseean, who served for two non-successive terms; Mirabeau B. Lamar, a Georgian, and Anson Jones, a New York man. Houston was not only the hero of the war of independence but had also served as a member of Congress and as Governor of Tennessee before coming to Texas. For a number of years he had lived as a member of a tribe of Cherokee Indians, where he gained experience that was extremely valuable to him in dealing with the Indians while he was President of the Texas Republic. Despite Houston&#x2019;s rigid economies the Indian and Mexican policies of President Lamar involved the Republic in heavy debt. When Texas was admitted to the Union there was outstanding more than twelve millions of dollars of paper money that had been issued by the Republic.</p>
<p class="ind"><span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" title="23"/>The famous homestead law, said to have been first prepared by Isaac Van Zandt, who left numerous descendants in Texas, was passed during Lamar&#x2019;s administration, and has been widely copied throughout the United States. Under the original law a person was allowed to keep his home, a definite number of acres, his furniture and tools, five cows, a yoke of oxen or a horse, twenty hogs, and provisions for a year. The present Texas homestead law, to the great distress and disadvantage of the homesteader&#x2019;s creditors, exempts business property that may be occupied by a skyscraper.</p>
<p class="ind">While President Lamar may be justly charged with being an unwise financier, he will be known for all time in Texas history as the constant and strong friend of public education. It was during his administration that a law was passed setting aside a body of land to each county to be held in trust for the public schools. President Lamar&#x2019;s eloquent communications to his Congress on the subject of education are yet models of wise foresight and statesmanlike grasp of the value to the state of an intelligent citizenship. A part of one of his periods is yet printed on every catalogue and pamphlet sent out by the University of Texas: &#x201C;Cultivated mind is the guardian genius of democracy.... It is the only dictator that freemen acknowledge and the only security that freemen desire.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">Despite, however, the influx of new citizens, the prosperity of the people, the richness of Texas soil, and the opportunities for establishing a free and independent and ultimately great Republic, Texans rejoiced at again becoming citizens of the mother country from which they had gone out into the wilderness. Texas cheerfully swapped its President for a <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page24" title="24"/>Governor, its Congress for a Legislature, disbanded its army, transferred its navy, recalled its ministers, abandoned its custom houses, ceased issuing money, and became a member of the sisterhood of states, soon to be plunged into a serious war with Mexico, wherein 8,000 Texas soldiers fought. The peace of 1848 transferred to the United States a territory which now embraces California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, and, besides, parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming. Thus Texas indirectly brought as her marriage portion a considerable body of territory, and the annexation of the state in connection with attendant consequences was one of the most important steps ever taken by the United States Government.</p>
<p class="ind">The claim of Texas to that portion of New Mexico east of the Rio Grande River aroused a good deal of bitter feeling on the part of many citizens,&#x2014;a complication finally settled by an agreement in which the United States paid to the state ten million dollars in return for its claim to New Mexico, this money to be used in paying the state&#x2019;s debts. This was done and all trouble avoided. Settlers from every state east of the Mississippi River, though in larger numbers from the Southern States, forded the Red River by thousands. As there were no railroads, the most of them came overland, driving mule or ox teams and riding in large covered wagons. Some took the water route down the Mississippi River, reshipping from New Orleans to Galveston or other Texas ports. The first railroad in the state was built in 1856. To encourage railroad building the state government lent the companies money from the public free school fund, giving sixteen sections of land or 10,240 acres for every mile of track completed. But <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" title="25"/>the outbreak of the Civil War stopped all railroad building. After the war the state concessions to the railroads were not quite so generous.</p>
<p class="ind">Coming usually from a timbered country, the immigrants to Texas naturally settled along the rivers where wood was abundant. The settlements started near the Gulf and gradually extended northward. It was first supposed that only the bottom lands were suitable for cultivation, and it was some years before the rich, level, and open uplands of the state were utilized for any purposes except for pasturage. In the &#x201C;black waxy&#x201D; region of the state the lands are at the present time much more valuable than the lowlands of the river bottoms. The early settlers thought that they would not only starve but that they would freeze to death if they built their cabins anywhere else except in the timbered stretches along the rivers.</p>
<p class="ind">Hardly a decade of peaceful statehood had elapsed before the people of Texas, along with the rest of the country, were in the midst of exciting controversies preceding the Civil War. When the question of secession came up for discussion Sam Houston, who was again the chief executive officer in Texas, vigorously opposed it. He was thereupon removed from office, and the convention called for the purpose voted to secede from the Union by a majority of 166 to 8. During the Civil War Texas furnished probably 100,000 soldiers to the Southern army. The history of this war will prove that they were good though sometimes reckless fighters. Their youthful recklessness is well illustrated in the story of a captain of cavalry, one George B. Zimpleman, who, on a bet that he could perform the feat, lassoed a Federal cavalry <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" title="26"/>officer while that gentleman was busy trying to kill him with his revolver, and brought him into camp, the Confederate meanwhile refusing to use any weapon at all except his cowboy rope. After arriving in camp Zimpleman apologized profusely to the captured officer because the astonished Federal had suffered a broken arm when the lasso jerked him from his horse. Another episode which is set out in various histories of the war tells how Galveston as well as a number of ships were captured by a fleet of improvised Confederate war vessels which had their decks piled with cotton to protect the riflemen. This new brand of warship was known as &#x201C;Cotton Clad.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="ind">Because of its far removal from the centre of combat in this war, Texas suffered less than any other Southern state. Indeed it is yet a boast of the people that every landing of Federal soldiers on Texas soil resulted in failure. Though invasions of the state were attempted at Sabine Pass, at Galveston, and at Brownsville, they were rendered fruitless through the resourceful intrepidity of the Texans&#x2019; defense. Being free of invasions, the work of raising crops, internal commerce, and other industries went forward. Numerous manufacturing plants were also an outgrowth of war conditions, and active trade with Mexico further rendered the position of Texas more fortunate than any other one of the seceded states. When the war ended and the Federal soldiers finally took possession, the proclamation freeing the negroes was made June 19,1865, thus establishing a negro holiday known as the &#x201C;Juneteenth,&#x201D; celebrated each year in fitting style throughout the state by the black man and all his people.</p>
<p class="ind">Gen. Phil Sheridan was a Federal officer whose duty it <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" title="27"/>was to impose the harsh military rule of reconstruction days on the people of Texas. His enforcement of the letter of that rule, with whatever amendments suggested themselves to him, made the lot of Texas as unhappy as any state in the South. Her duly-elected officers were forcibly removed, her laws disregarded, and the rights of her citizens shamefully trampled on in a thousand ways by the edicts of military men. A radical legislature, which remained in session continuously for twelve months, by its reckless waste of public funds increased the tax rate 1,400 per cent. in four years. But civil quiet and a fair degree of contentment again succeeded when Richard Coke, afterward distinguished as a United States Senator, upon being duly elected took forcible possession of the office of Governor in 1874, despite the appeals of Governor E. J. Davis to President Grant. The reconstruction constitution of 1869 was speedily annulled and a new constitution, known as the Constitution of 1876, under which the state is now operated, was adopted by a convention of legally qualified delegates and later ratified by the people.</p>
