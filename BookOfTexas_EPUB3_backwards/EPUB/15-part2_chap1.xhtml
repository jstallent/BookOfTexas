	<aside class="hidden" id="table01_cap">The table shows the growth of the population of Texas each decade from 1850 to 1920, as a whole number, as a percentage of increase over the previous decade, and as a percentage of the population of the United States.</aside>
</div>
<p class="ind">The density of population, sixteen per square mile, one person to every forty acres, is about half the average for the United States. Texas is more thickly settled than the <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page44" title="44"/>&#x201C;Mountain States,&#x201D; or the Dakotas, and is just about as thickly populated as Florida, Nebraska, Oregon, or California. Less than twenty thousand whites in 1835, more than three and one-half million in 1915, is the record of eighty years.</p>
<p class="ind">The average number of persons to a family is 4.9, which, compared with Uncle Sam&#x2019;s average of 4.5, shows that race suicide is not as popular in Texas as in some other places. A favorite remark in the arid country is: &#x201C;The baby crop is the certainest one we have.&#x201D; This crop, however, has decreased relatively very much since frontier times, the decrease being especially marked in the towns, which have in proportion to population only two-thirds as many children as the country. Compared with Massachusetts, the birth rate seems to be half again as large, which is one of the reasons why there are forty-six people only in every hundred in Massachusetts, and sixty in Texas, under twenty-five years of age. Approximately, there are five persons to a dwelling, from which fact it is easy to see that apartment and tenement houses have not yet risen in large numbers. In crowded New York City, for example, there are sixteen persons to a dwelling, thirty-one if Manhattan Borough alone is considered. Naturally, nearly all of the dwellings occupied by more than one family are in the towns, over half of them being in the eight largest cities.</p>
<p class="ind">When we are told that only one-sixth of Texas has been plowed and that most of this sixth is not cultivated at all intensively, the population possibilities begin to dawn upon us. More than half of Texas is fertile soil, and, allowing two acres to a person, 40,000,000 people, the present population <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page45" title="45"/>of France, becomes a probability of the not very distant future. Dallas County, the most densely populated area, with ten times the average density, is not yet as thickly populated as Pennsylvania, nor half as thickly as Massachusetts or Germany or New Jersey. As yet Texas is not causing New York any uneasiness as to first place in population; but observe the results of the race so far between the states at each twenty-year interval: Texas was twenty-fifth in 1850, nineteenth in 1870, seventh in 1890, and fifth in 1910. Ohio will be the next to see Texas pass her on the way to first place, which, being long-winded, Texas is sure to reach, and, reaching, sure to hold forevermore.</p>
<p class="ind">The density of population by counties ranges from one person for each ten square miles to 158 a square mile. It is possible to pass from crowded city blocks through spreading suburbs and small farms to large pastures where houses are many miles apart. To understand at all the distribution of population in Texas it will be necessary for even the casual reader to look at the accompanying population map in connection with the geological map on page 67 and the map of the natural life zones on page 90. Unless to do so strains too much the mind of the reader, these maps should be imagined superposed upon one another.</p>
<p class="ind">Such a superposition reveals the fact that the Black Prairie is the most densely populated portion of the state, with about fifty persons or more to the square mile. Eastward the density decreases slowly, northeast Texas being fairly uniformly occupied with some thirty-five people to the square mile: westward the density thins rapidly at first and slowly afterward, with the exception of an increase <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page46" title="46"/>in the heart of the Red Beds country; south westward it thins slowly till the boundary between the Humid and Mesquite Zone is reached, where there is a rapid thinning out, exception being made of San Antonio, which is the commercial capital of a vast, thinly settled region to the south and west; southeastward toward the coast the density thins slowly, exception being made of the Beaumont-Orange and Houston-Galveston centres, each due to railroads, harbors, lumber, oil fields, and various other causes. The most sudden drop in population is encountered crossing westward a long S-shaped line that runs between Bexar and Cook counties. This S is a geological line which marks the surface boundaries of the Upper and Lower Limestones <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page47" title="47"/>in south central Texas, the Lower Limestones and the Coal Measures in north Texas.</p>

<p class="ind">Rainfall and soil have been the main factors in locating all of the rural population and most of the urban. Much timber has had some effect as a deterrent, requiring work to remove it. The long-leaf pine area is clearly marked as one of sparse population: where so many fine trees grow there is little room left for people. Considerations of health have attracted people from the moist east to the dry west. When a malarial mosquito bites an east Texan and starts him to &#x201C;chillin&#x2019;,&#x201D; he forgets his superabundant fruits and vegetables, and the dry country looks good to him; but when he gets there, he yearns for the east Texas rains. Hence oscillations of population which were marked in early days, and still are to some extent, by the passing along the roads of &#x201C;prairie schooners,&#x201D; canvas-covered wagons, loaded with wife, children, and household effects, and followed by more children, horses, dogs, mules, cows, and calves. Every now and then the immigrant stuck up signs expressive of his disgust, &#x201C;Nine inches to hell!&#x201D; &#x201C;Sixty miles to water!&#x201D; and &#x201C;Damn this country!&#x201D; being favorites. Obviously one can&#x2019;t have all the delights of clear, dry weather while it is raining, or cheap land in a thickly populated country. The booster of any particular town or county usually has plenty of good things to say about it, some true and some o&#x2019;ergilded by a luxuriant and not always disinterested imagination; but a happy prosperity is easily possible anywhere in Texas if one works with and not against nature.</p>
<p class="ind">The extreme contrasts that exist between the different portions of Texas are the subjects of much good-natured <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page48" title="48"/>repartee. The prairie man derides the man who lives &#x201C;in the sticks,&#x201D; while the man from the timber country replies with derogatory references to windmills and jack rabbits. The east Texan admits that he has sand between his toes; the Trans-Pecos man says that water is so scarce in his country that some frogs there two years old do not yet know how to swim.</p>
<p class="ind">Texas is overwhelmingly rural: its smaller towns are small islands almost submerged in a great agricultural sea. At least two out of every three Texans live in the open country, and less than one in five in towns of more than ten thousand. The people, however, are moving to town: in 1900 there were fifty-six towns of over 2,500 people, in 1910 there were ninety-nine, and now there are more than a hundred. In the last twenty-five years the number of smaller towns has doubled, although their total population has merely kept pace with the general growth in numbers. It is the larger towns that are growing so much faster than the country. The growth in the country and smaller towns for the last census period was 19 per cent.; in the towns and cities above 2,500 in population it was 68 per cent.; in the eight largest cities it was 77 per cent. (despite the fact that the great storm of 1900 caused the population of Galveston, one of the eight, to remain nearly stationary during the census decade); in the five largest cities it was 107 per cent. During the same period the towns above 2,500 in the United States showed an increase of 34 per cent., and the rest of the country an increase of 11 per cent. The towns and cities of the United States therefore increased proportionately three times as fast as the country: in Texas they increased <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page49" title="49"/>almost four times as fast. Yet so overwhelming is the proportion of rural population that an increase of 19 per cent. for it meant an absolute increase of 470,000, while an increase of 68 per cent. in the total population of the towns above 2,500 meant an increase of only 378,000. In the accompanying table the percentage distribution of the population of Texas into rural and urban is given and compared with that of the United States.</p>

<p class="ind">The four counties having the four largest cities showed population increases above 50,000, Tarrant County with 56,000 carrying away the banner. Three large agricultural counties&#x2014;Washington, Fannin, and Fayette&#x2014;showed decreases of about 7,000 each. All told, there were thirty-four agricultural or stock-raising counties that showed decreases in their population from 1900 to 1910, most of these counties lying near the centre of the southeastern third of the state. River overflows, boll weevils, and the call of the cheaper lands to the west were the causes of these losses, which have helped to increase so greatly the population of the northwestern half of the state. Here and there the towns have lost relatively to the surrounding country. Increased transportation facilities, especially the interurban electrics, are causing and will doubtless continue to cause <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page50" title="50"/>the cities to grow at the expense of their nearby towns. People from other states have been pouring into west Texas, into the Coastal Plain, and also into all other parts of the state. &#x201C;Homeseekers&#x2019; excursions&#x201D; have been for years a regular part of the program of the railways.</p>
<p class="ind">Let us close this chapter somewhat irrelevantly with a number of scattered facts concerning the 252 counties of Texas. El Paso, with 5,570 square miles (about the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined), is the largest county, and Rockwall, with 140 square miles, is the smallest. There are three counties each about the size of Connecticut, and ten each larger than Delaware. The average county is nearly the size of Rhode Island. A great many of the counties are squares, with thirty miles to a side. Dallas County has the largest population, 150,000 or more, and Cochran has the smallest, about 100. The average county now has a population of about 18,000.</p>
<p class="ind">Although the counties of Texas in most cases have only arbitrary boundaries, the older counties particularly have individualities of their own, and there are printed histories of some of them. The Texan thinks of the counties in relation to the state in about the same way that he thinks of the state in relation to the United States. Larger senatorial or congressional districts have no such individualities, on account of frequent changes in their boundaries.</p>
<p class="ind">The counties of Texas are so numerous that nearly every person of any importance in Texas history has been remembered in naming them. Spanish governors, explorers, early settlers, statesmen and politicians, jurists, soldiers, and even three historians have had their memories thus perpetuated. <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page51" title="51"/>As if the learning of Texas political geography were not otherwise hard enough, there has been a confusing mix-up in the naming of towns and counties. Athens is in Henderson County, Henderson is in Rusk County, Rusk is in Cherokee County, and Cherokee&#x2014;well, there are two or three Cherokees in as many counties. Aransas Pass is in Patricio County, while Rockport is in Aransas County; Beaumont is in Jefferson County, while Jefferson is in Marion. Austin is not in Austin County nor Bellville in Bell County nor Houston in Houston County nor Franklin in Franklin County; while Dallas is in Dallas County, El Paso in El Paso, Galveston in Galveston, and Gonzales in Gonzales. There is no regularity amid the irregularity, and one is reminded of those exceptions in the grammar which overshadow the rules. Worst of all, Up<em>land</em> is the county seat of Up<em>ton</em>.</p>
<p class="ind">During the last decade there were some counties in the west that put to shame any percentages listed in usury laws. Several increased in population over 2,000 per cent., one over 6,000, one nearly 8,000, while Lynn County, by increasing from 17 to over 1,700 in population, carried off the prize at 10,000 per cent.</p>
