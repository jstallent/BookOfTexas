The process seems as magical as those whereof we read in fairy legends, where circles are drawn, wands waved, mystic syllables pronounced. Adjured by these rites, voices speak, or forms and faces shape themselves from nothing. So, through certain influences not magical at all, our brains are made to flash with visions of other days.&#x201D;<span class="source">&#x2014;Owen Witter</span>.</p>

<p class="first"><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="leadin">ne hundred years ago</span> there was scarcely a handful of white men in that section of North America now known as Texas, and these were not permanent settlers. The entire region was virgin soil populated only by Indians and a few Spanish soldiers, and overrun by wild cattle, mustang ponies, countless herds of buffalo, deer, antelope, wolves, and other wild animals. The passage of a century has converted the vast region west of the Mississippi into states, Texas alone containing four and a half millions of people and seven billions of wealth. To describe the raw material, the people, and the land; to picture the transformation that has been wrought in Texas during this time, particularly in its important and dramatic aspects; to trace, however inadequately, in small compass the result of the action of the people upon the land and its resources, and the results of the action of the people upon themselves until they have won some individuality and definable characteristics, is what the writers of this volume have undertaken. It is the old and well-known story of man either conquering or adapting himself to the forces of nature.</p>
<p class="ind"><span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page4" title="4"/>Conventional history is too often inclined to concern itself mainly with dates, wars, and with the names and careers of military and political leaders, together with incidents which have little or nothing to do with the real development of a country. Texas, for example, is perhaps no whit different from what it would have been had <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_lasalle">La Salle</a> not explored it in early times and died within its confines, or had the Spaniards <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_cabeza">Cabeza de Vaca</a> and <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_coronado">Coronado</a> not wandered over its trackless plains in the early years of the seventeenth century. Even such men as <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> and <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_houston">Sam Houston</a>, however important their place in history, did not make Texas. The destiny of a state is seldom embodied in one man. In the first place, the state is what it is because of the natural conditions that have existed; and, in the second place, because of the general character of the people who have settled within its borders.</p>
<p class="ind">The records of any historian, however impartial, must nevertheless of necessity seem a form of hero worship. In the history of Texas many individuals stand out above their fellows as superior in bravery, in resourcefulness, and in other qualities of leadership. However hard we try to set down the bare facts, the halo of romance creeps into the story and glorifies such names as <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_lasalle">La Salle</a>, the restless Frenchman; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_coronado">Coronado</a>, the enterprising Spanish gold hunter; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>, the patient, unselfish father of a new republic, who died early in life through exposure in her service; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_travis">Travis</a>, the commander of the group of heroes in the Alamo; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_houston">General Sam Houston</a>, brave and impassioned leader of men, in defeat taciturn as an Indian; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_lamar">Mirabeau B. Lamar</a>, gifted orator and friend of enlightenment <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page5" title="5"/>through public education; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_roberts">O. M. Roberts</a>, the &#x201C;Old Alcalde&#x201D; and &#x201C;Pay as You Go&#x201D; Governor, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, law professor in the University of Texas; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_reagan">John H. Reagan</a>, Postmaster-General of the Confederate Cabinet, Member of Congress, U. S. Senator, first head of the Texas Railroad Commission; <a class="glossref" href="20-glossary.xhtml#g_hogg">James Stephen Hogg</a>, Texas&#x2019; greatest Governor, progressive statesman, and friend of the people; George W. Brackenridge, Henry Rosenberg, and William M. Rice, philanthropists; Henry Exall, evangel of scientific farming; T. V. Munson, honored by the French Government for achievement in grape culture. To the memory of the men who founded colleges in places where the Indian war whoop yet sounded; to those who preached the gospel, who healed the sick, who framed the laws, who cleared the land and blazed the way for the millions who now live between the Rio Grande and Red rivers&#x2014;romance and story and song and drama will yet arise, fit and commensurate.</p>

<p class="ind">The events that have affected the lives of a people, the difficulties they have overcome, the deeds they have wrought, the battles they have fought, the institutions they have set up&#x2014;all these help us to know what the people are. The annals of a people faithfully recorded make the past live again and show us, if not the people themselves, the results of their actions. So, poring over the story of their brave deeds and peering behind the framework of governmental and social machinery they have invented, inherited, or modified; the record of their war with nature and their clashes with each other, we may come to know <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page6" title="6"/>something of the real people. The Earth and the People: what the Earth held in store and what the People did with its riches and to each other,&#x2014;these are the vital elements in history, the moving pictures of the past thrown on the screen that enable those of the present to vision what has gone before. Let us see first how Texas was possessed by the white race and by what means the peoples were welded into that semblance of unity which is termed a state.</p>
<p class="ind">Some of the incidents are mentioned partly because they occurred in Texas territory and not because they influenced the life of the state as it now is. In setting them out we shall consciously emphasize the particular contributions that Texas seems to have made to the sum total of human progress. The general growth of the state has been, on the whole, not unlike that of other Western commonwealths. It does, however, possess some individual characteristics. For example, six different flags have waved over its fortunes, one of them the Lone Star while Texas was for nearly ten years a free and independent republic; her independence was won by a successfully waged revolution; the state has maintained until now a citizen soldiery known as the Texas Rangers. The Railroad Commission, a widely copied homestead law, the commission form of government, a lavish land and bonded endowment for the free public school system, are other illustrative examples of noteworthy contributions. So the story shall be interlarded with references to what Texas has originated, that the narrative may not lose its declared intention of singing the glories of the state.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page7" title="7"/>Within thirty-five years after Columbus discovered America the first white man set foot on Texas soil. He belonged to an exploring party of Spaniards, Conquistadores, men of like mold with Cortez and his companions, who sailed from Cuba and were wrecked on the coast off Galveston. Other Spanish gold-hunting bands traversed portions of Texas during the next century and a half, but made no efforts to establish permanent settlements. In 1682 La Salle, a Frenchman, coming down from Canada to the mouth of the Mississippi River, set up a claim to all the land (Louisiana) drained by the river. Later driven west in a storm while he was trying to reach the mouth of the Mississippi from France some of his ships were lost, and the others returned to France. He thereupon built Fort St. Louis, the first attempt at a permanent settlement in Texas. La Salle was afterward killed by one of his own men. Others of his party died of smallpox and malarial fever, were killed by the Indians, or murdered each other in the diverting pastime of duelling. So thoroughly was the site of his fort ultimately lost, after the Spaniards burned it, that a college professor only rediscovered it in 1914. The French made other more permanent settlements in Louisiana and Alabama which later gave La Salle&#x2019;s claim to the Mississippi Valley real standing. Northeast of La Salle&#x2019;s Texas fort lived the Tejas (TaTias) Indians, who for some time harbored four of his unfortunate companions, and whose tribal designation finally grew into the name of Texas. Among these Indians Spanish priests, sent with the Spanish soldiers who destroyed Fort St. Louis, built a church on Texas soil, the first of a chain of mission church buildings, the beautiful ruins of some yet serving <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page8" title="8"/>as attractions for tourists. Along with these missions established to Christianize the Indians, the Spaniards sometimes built forts, as at San Antonio, to hold the country against the French. In east Texas the forts at Nacogdoches and vicinity were abandoned, the first time because of the attacks of the French from Louisiana, and again in 1762, when France ceded to Spain her claim on all the region west of the Mississippi River. Seventeen years afterward the Spaniards again took possession of Nacogdoches. Nearly two hundred years of occupation had, by 1800, yielded only the net results of three permanent settlements in Texas,&#x2014;San Antonio, Nacogdoches, and Goliad, the latter being the legitimate offspring of Fort St. Louis. What barren results and of what insignificant influence on the development of Texas&#x2014;when it really started to grow!</p>
<p class="ind">When France regained the territory ceded to Spain and sold it to the United States in 1803, its western boundary was uncertain. In 1806 an agreement between General James Wilkinson, that picturesque rascal who commanded the United States army in the west, and General Herrera established a neutral strip between the Arroyo Hondo and the Sabine. This No Man&#x2019;s Land thereafter became a convenient and safe harborage for adventurers and desperadoes who in their expeditions into Texas brought back information about its advantages that made others covet its possession. Independent forays were organized by different groups of these restless characters in efforts to take Texas away from Spain, while about the same time the French pirate, Jean Lafitte, found Galveston Island a safe harborage. Lafitte and his pirates and the men that infested No Man&#x2019;s Land did two <span class="pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page9" title="9"/>things for Texas: they introduced knowledge of it to the United States and they first gave it the bad name which added undue weight to a famous remark made by Phil Sheridan after the Civil War, while he was stationed in an arid locality in Texas.</p>
